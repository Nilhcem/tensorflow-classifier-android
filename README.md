# TensorFlow (1.2.0) Image Classifier Gradle Standalone Port

- Clone the project
- Import it on Android Studio
- Run it
- That's all.

This project is a way to get started with TensorFlow Image Classifier quickly.

I am not planning to maintain it. If you want an updated version, build it yourself.

(Hints on how to do it on this [blog post][blog-post])
